# 3DMouth_LED matrix
The robot's mouth is designed using an LED matrix, from the electronics track. I used a MAX7219 circuit to display a moving mouth on the matrix.

It is programmed to display the mouth in two states: open and closed, and the display is constantly updated using functions like "displayTalkingMouth" and "clearDisplay". **(The code for this project is attached to the repository)**

I selected the state using "8x8 BINARY PATTERN".
